<h1>Community Thought Bot</h1>
</hr>

This is a small project where I created a Discord bot that takes what a community member say on Discord and post it to [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ShulThoughts)!

<h3>What am I trying to achieve?</h3>

The main goal I want to tackle is using two different APIs (Discord and Twitter) and creating a product that is functional.

<h3>Does it work?</h3>

Yes, and no. I wish I could show the progress I made, but I chose to push it into GitHub a bit too late. Since Elon Musk gained control of Twitter, V1 of the Twitter API is not functional. I have updated the app to V2 and fixed the problems along with it, but the API wrapper that I use is no longer functional under Twitter API V2 due to the changes of Elon Musk. Elon Musk effectively cauterized the developer community trying to fix the bot problem and the bot problem still runs rampant to this day.

If I can find a fix, then I may continue with this project in the future and tack on more challenges. I must learn how to create an API myself sometime down the road!
